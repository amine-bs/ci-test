description: Spark SQL can also act as a distributed query engine using its JDBC/ODBC
  or command-line interface. In this mode, end-users or applications can interact
  with Spark SQL directly to run SQL queries, without the need to write any code.
  The Thrift JDBC/ODBC server implemented here corresponds to the HiveServer2 in built-in
  Hive.
